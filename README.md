# Bicyclefinder

Xamarin.Forms
Rental bike locator leveraging citybik.es


Current Issues:


  a little messy and needs efficiency improvements


  no Android version - only have the iOS side implemented


  no WP version - will come after I do the Android side


  no clustering - the "take off your glasses and squint a little if you want to see multiple pins mix into one" method is currently used, cf. efficieny comment above
