# Bicyclefinder

Xamarin.Forms
Rental bike locator leveraging citybik.es


Current Issues:


  a little messy and needs efficiency improvements


  no Android version - only have the iOS side implemented


  no WP version - will come after I do the Android side


  no clustering - the "take off your glasses and squint a little if you want to see multiple pins mix into one" method is currently used, cf. efficiency comment above



This is a hobby project of mine, created over a few minutes here and there. It may break with web or OS API changes, which I will fix as/when. If you're interested in contributing/working on this app to give it a more professional look and feel then get in touch.
